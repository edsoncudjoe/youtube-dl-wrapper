Wrapper script to download and play videos with youtube-dl.

Goals:
 Retry failed downloads
 Prevent duplicate downloads
 Prevent overlapping download processes (two processes downloading the same file)
 Handle all URLs that youtube-dl naively handles (including the generic last resort extractor)

Dependencies:
 youtube-dl	https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl.git
 xclip
 lsof
 python3


I cleaned this up a bit to post, no doubt it has bugs. Patches welcome.
